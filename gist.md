# Title (replace with your title)

Have you ever wondered what the string of numbers and symbols used in a search pattern is? Well, look no further. These expressions, called regex expressions were developed by computer scientist Stephen Cole Kleene and describe how you might search for something in vast amounts of text. 

## Summary

/[ap+]\l(e|s)/

What word am I searching for? Today I will be explaining how regex searches for different characters and numbers in a text editting software. In the expression above, the search is telling it to look for a series of alpha numeric characters in the following paragraph: 

Apples are the best. They have the flavor of a sweet and tart candy. When you bite into an apple the tast is great. Even aligators like apples! 

In searching for ap+ it is looking for something that returns a word with ap and more than one 'p' characters after it. Therefore, this search would most likely return the word apple, but we will see more as we continue to explore what the characters mean.

## Regex Components

In a regex expression, we can break the components into anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, or operators, flags and character escapes. Each of these symbols or group of symbols plays a role in understanding how the search is created. By understanding these roles, you can interpret this foreign seeming expression above.
